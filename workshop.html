      <div class="section">
	<p>IN/Clojure is conducting an introductory workshop to Clojure and functional programming on January 12.</p>
	<p>Check back here after the 15th of December for updates on workshop prerequisites and instructions on how to set up
          your development environment!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
	<h3 class="section-title">Who is it for?</h3>
	<ul>
          <li>Programmers proficient in at least one programming language and who want to learn Clojure</li>
          <li>Beginners to functional programming</li>
	</ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
	<h3 class="section-title">Overview</h3>
	<p>The workshop will be mostly example-driven, with lots of
          code to follow along with and evaluate in the REPL, interspersed with exercises.
          The goal is <strong>not</strong> to exhaustively cover all of Clojure's features in-depth. Rather,
          we want to provide the attendee with enough of an intuitive understanding of Clojure's
          capabilities that they can dive deeper into the language later, at their own pace.
	</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
	<h3 class="section-title">Guiding Principles</h3>
	<p>What could one do with <i>just a little bit</i> of Clojure?</p>
	<div>
          <h5>Goals</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Acquire a "feel" of Clojure, for further self-study/exploration.</li>
            <li>Learn how Clojurists usually think with Clojure to solve problems.</li>
            <li>See how it's not so hard to do surprisingly powerful things with a
              mere handful of "primitive" functions, data structures, and ideas.</li>
          </ul>
	</div>
	<div>
          <h5>Non-Goals</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Try to explain Functional Programming theory or Clojure's innards.
              (Many free and paid tutorials and books do so very well.)</li>
            <li>Try to exhaustively cover Clojure primitives/features. (That's homework!)</li>
            <li>Devolve into language wars, editor wars, syntax wars, type wars...
              (Life's too short, people.)</li>
            <li>Focus too much on tooling or operational things. (At least not
              while there's fun to be had!)</li>
          </ul>
	</div>
	<div>
          <h5>How to approach this workshop</h5>
          <p>Think of this as an exercise in constrained creativity.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ignore details, achieve much with as little know-how as possible.</li>
            <li>Focus on what things do; not what they are, or why they are.</li>
            <li>Inform your <i>intuition for doing things</i>, and then use that to dive
              deeper into all the juicy details at your own pace, later.
            </li>
            <li>Take what is useful, discard the rest.</li>
          </ul>
	</div>
	<div>
          <h5>Philosophy</h5>
          <p>Almost anyone can hope to do more with more. Up to a point, that is.</p>
          <p>Far too often, we end up doing <i>less</i> with more; bogged down by the
            complexity of too much choice.
          </p>
          <p>Figuring out how to do more with less feeds our curiosity, and often
            satisfies and empowers us.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, may you stay small and achieve important things.
          </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3 class="section-title">Setup Instructions</h3>
      
      <h5>Java 8</h5>
      <p>You will need Java to work with Clojure. Run <code>java -version</code> in your terminal. If Java is not installed, please 
        download and install it from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">here.</a>
        Once you are done, <code>java -version</code> should show you a Java 1.8.x version.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NOTE: </strong>Java 9 is known to have issues with Light Table, the editor that we recommend for the workshop, and 
        with some versions of certain Clojure libraries.
      </p>

      <h5>Leiningen</h5>
      <p>
        Leiningen is a Clojure command line tool used to manage projects. To install it, follow the instructions 
        <a href="https://leiningen.org/#install">here</a>. After installation, <code>lein version</code> should print both the 
        Leiningen version and the Java version. 
      </p>

      <h5>LightTable</h5>
      <p>
        LightTable is one of many Clojure editors. There are setups possible with vim, emacs and more, but for the workshop we will only 
        support Light Table officially.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please download and install LightTable from <a href="http://lighttable.com/">here</a>. Note that on Mac OS, you may have to allow
        running the app in your security preferences to be able to open it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once LightTable is installed, open it and go to View -> Plugin Manager and search for "parinfer". Install the Parinfer plugin by 
        Maur√≠cio Szabo. Parinfer is an editing system for Clojure that makes it easy for you to move Clojure code around without 
        unbalancing parentheses. Although we'll have a small introductory session on Parinfer at the workshop, we also recommend going through
        the Parinfer documentation <a href="https://shaunlebron.github.io/parinfer/">here</a>.
