	    GO-JEK is Indonesia’s first unicorn is currently the fastest growing start-up in South Asia and the largest in Indonesia in terms of valuation, funding raised and a number of transactions. Having started as a bike-taxi hailing business, the start-up grew more than 900X (that's 90,000%) in just 18 months and diversified into food delivery, one-hour courier delivery, grocery delivery and has even aggregated trucks on its platform. It has partnered with over 900,000 two wheel and four wheel drivers and 5,000 trucks across Indonesia, all of whom, collectively cover an average distance of 7 million kilometers each day.
	  </p> <p>
	    In October 2017, GO-JEK had raised over $1.2 billion in a new round of funding led by Tencent holding and in August 2016, $550 million in the previous funding by KKR and Warburg Pincus LLC, the largest ever for an Indonesian technology start-up. GO-JEK is now the largest food delivery company in the world outside the China market and is the equivalent of three Indian Unicorns combined in the transport, food delivery, and payments markets.

	    With over 40 million app downloads, GO-JEK's platform powers the Indonesian equivalents of Indian Taxi Aggregators, Food Delivery Start-Ups, HyperLocal Start-Ups, Digital Wallet startups and Home Service based startups, all in one, at a comparable scale. Its GO-FOOD business alone does more daily orders than all Indian food tech start-ups combined.
