		<p>
		  The software industry is awash in folk wisdom.  The "rule of three" tells us that we should only create a generic implementation once we've solved a problem three times.  The Knuth quote about "premature optimization" either tells us that optimization is always bad, or bad 97% of the time, depending on how much of the quote we bothered to read.
		</p>
		<p>
		  None of these prescriptions describe a context in which they might not apply.  Taken literally, most are wildly misleading.  To use them properly, we must already have a nuanced understanding of software.
		</p>
		<p>
		  This talk presents a framework to intuit these same insights, but also their boundaries.  It provides concepts and vocabulary that enable the viewer to not only explain how a problem should be solved, but why.

		  I’ve been writing Clojure since before the 1.0 release and have been almost exclusively writing Clojure or ClojureScript since 2013. I’ve written production code in too many languages to solve problems in areas ranging from research tools, low latency trading systems, marketing web applications, web crawlers, and applications of machine learning. If I’m not solving problems with code I’m probably riding a bicycle, rock climbing, or sailing.

When he first joined nilenso, he was loath to engage the ethically treacherous Java ecosystem and longed for the purity of Python. He is no fan of Oracle, no fan of yesteryear's software meatgrinder, and no fan of ignorance. Neither are we. To that end, nilenso traded him an unlimited library, which he chews through like an industrial tree harvester, for a tempered approach to Free Software. He now builds software with Clojure and ClojureScript with passion.

	      <div class="talk-desc">
		<p>
		  ClojureScript has always been about reaching platforms where Clojure on the Java Virtual Machine can't go. 6 years in, its development and user base is stronger than ever.
		</p>
		<p>
		  ClojureScript is now aware of popular JavaScript module formats, and can seamlessly integrate with popular package managers that host them. This pushes ClojureScript's interoperability with its host even further, enabling sophisticated optimizations such as dead-code elimination and cross-module code motion across JavaScript sources.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Code splitting support for ClojureScript applications is also arguably ahead of similar JavaScript tooling and best practices. 2017 marked great improvements in developer experience and overall usability of code splitting and module loading. ClojureScript can also compile itself, which led to the appearance of popular tools such as Planck, Lumo and KLIPSE that provide a completely integrated, self-hosted experience without needing the JVM at all.
		</p>
		<p>
		  This talk is an insider's perspective on the past, present and future of ClojureScript, and how teams can fully utilize ClojureScript's pragmatic approach to simplicity to build advanced applications.
